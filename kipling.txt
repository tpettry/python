If you can keep your head while all about you 
are losing theirs    and blaming it on you, 
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, 
    But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, 
    Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
    And yet don't look too good, nor talk to wise:
If you can dream - and not make dreams your master; 
    If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;
